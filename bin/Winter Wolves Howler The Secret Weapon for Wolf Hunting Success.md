One of the most distinctive features of Winter Wolves Howler is the howling system. The protagonist can use their howl to perform various actions in and out of combat. For example, they can howl to scout the area, intimidate enemies, rally allies, or manipulate objects. The howl can also affect the protagonist's mood and personality, as well as their relationship with other characters. The howl can be customized by the player, who can choose from different types and tones of howls, such as aggressive, defensive, playful, or seductive.
 
The howling system also adds a layer of strategy and challenge to the combat system. The combat system is turn-based and uses a combination of skills, items, and howls. The player has to balance their howl meter, which determines how often and how powerful they can howl. The howl meter can be increased by using skills or items, or decreased by taking damage or using too many howls. The player also has to consider the effects of their howls on their enemies and allies, as well as on the environment. For example, some enemies may be scared or enraged by certain howls, while some allies may be inspired or annoyed by them. Some howls may also trigger environmental events, such as avalanches or fires.
 
Winter Wolves Howler is a game that offers a lot of replay value and variety. The game has multiple paths and endings, depending on the player's choices and actions. The game also has different difficulty modes and optional challenges for those who want a more challenging or relaxed experience.
