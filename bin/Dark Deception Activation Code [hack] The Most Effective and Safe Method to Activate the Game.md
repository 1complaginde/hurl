# How to Hack Dark Deception with Console Commands
 
Dark Deception is a horror game that challenges you to collect ring pieces while avoiding deadly enemies in various levels. The game is fun and scary, but what if you want to spice things up a bit? What if you want to create your own hell, or make the game easier or harder?
 
Well, there is a way to do that with console commands. Console commands are commands that you can type in the game's console to change various aspects of the game, such as spawning enemies, changing the brightness, modifying your speed, and more. However, console commands are not officially supported by the developers, and they may cause bugs or glitches in the game. Use them at your own risk!

To access the console, you need to download a tool called UUU Client from [this link](https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm). This tool will allow you to unlock the console in any Unreal Engine 4 game, including Dark Deception. Follow the instructions on the website to install and run the tool.
 
Once you have the tool running, launch Dark Deception and press the tilde key (~) to open the console. You should see a prompt where you can type in commands. To see a list of available commands, type "help" and press enter. You can also find a list of commands for Dark Deception [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1URWWKW4eGAYST3T--t90Zphdf_cE8AHJ/view?usp=sharing).
 
Some examples of commands you can try are:
 
- god - Enables god mode, making you invincible.
- slomo x - Changes the game speed by a factor of x. For example, slomo 0.5 will make the game half as fast, and slomo 2 will make it twice as fast.
- summon x - Spawns an enemy of type x. For example, summon BP\_Teddy will spawn a teddy bear enemy.
- r.bloomquality 0 - Disables bloom effect, making the game less bright.
- r.setres 1920x1080f - Changes the resolution to 1920x1080 in fullscreen mode.

Have fun experimenting with different commands and creating your own scenarios in Dark Deception. Just remember to save your progress before using them, and don't blame me if something goes wrong!

- Use the stun orb power-up to temporarily freeze the monkeys in place. This can give you some breathing room or help you escape a tight spot.
- Use the reveal shard power-up to highlight all the shards in the maze. This can help you find the ones you missed or plan your route more efficiently.
- Don't panic if you get caught by a monkey. You have five lives, and you can resume from where you left off. Just try to avoid them as much as possible.

## Elementary Evil
 
This is the second level of the game, and it introduces you to a new enemy: Agatha, a creepy little girl who can teleport and scream. You have to collect 300 shards in an abandoned school while being stalked by Agatha. Here are some tips for this level:

- Use your headphones to listen for Agatha's voice and laughter. She will taunt you or warn you if she is about to teleport or scream.
- Use your map to find the classrooms and hallways where the shards are. The map will also show you where Agatha is, as well as the location of the secret rooms.
- Use the speed boost power-up to outrun Agatha or escape her scream. The speed boost will also allow you to jump over obstacles and gaps in the floor.
- Use the teleport power-up to instantly move to another location in the school. This can help you avoid Agatha or reach a distant shard.
- Don't look at Agatha if she teleports in front of you. She will scream and stun you for a few seconds, leaving you vulnerable. Look away or run past her as fast as you can.

## Deadly Decadence
 
This is the third level of the game, and it introduces you to a new enemy: Gold Watchers, statues that can only move when you are not looking at them. You have to collect 400 shards in a mansion while being surrounded by Gold Watchers. Here are some tips for this level:

- Use your headphones to listen for the Gold Watchers' footsteps and breathing. They will make noise when they move or when they are close to you.
- Use your map to find the rooms and corridors where the shards are. The map will also show you where the Gold Watchers are, as well as the location of the secret rooms.
- Use the primal fear power-up to scare away all the Gold Watchers in your vicinity. This can give you some space or help you clear a room of shards.
- Use the invisibility power-up to become invisible to the Gold Watchers for a short time. This can help you sneak past them or reach a hard-to-get shard.
- Don't turn your back on the Gold Watchers if they are nearby. They will move faster and catch up to you quickly. Keep them in your sight or run away from them as fast as you can.
