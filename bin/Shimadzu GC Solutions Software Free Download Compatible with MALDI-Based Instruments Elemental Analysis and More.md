Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Shimadzu GC Solutions software for free. You can now enjoy its benefits and features for your GCMS analysis.
  
Shimadzu GC Solutions software is designed to enhance the performance and productivity of your GCMS analysis. It allows you to create and edit methods, set parameters, monitor instrument status, and control data acquisition. You can also perform various data processing functions, such as peak detection, integration, identification, quantitation, and calibration. The software also supports various data formats, such as netCDF, ANDI, and Shimadzu QGD.
 
One of the features of Shimadzu GC Solutions software is the Advanced Flow Technology (AFT) software. This software enables you to perform advanced flow control techniques, such as backflushing, heart-cutting, and multi-dimensional GC. These techniques can help you improve the separation and analysis of complex samples, reduce analysis time and cost, and extend the life of your column and detector. You can easily set up and execute these techniques using the graphical user interface of the AFT software.
 
Another feature of Shimadzu GC Solutions software is the Restore function. This function allows you to recover the original data from a thermal desorption (TD) analysis that was affected by contamination or interference. You can select the regions of interest in the chromatogram and restore them to their original state using a reference spectrum. This function can help you improve the accuracy and reliability of your TD-GCMS analysis.
