In his speech, Iqbal argued that Islam was not only a religion but also a way of life and a source of political and cultural identity for the Muslims. He criticized the secular nationalism of the Indian National Congress and the Hindu revivalism of the Arya Samaj as threats to the Muslim identity and unity. He proposed that the Muslims of India should form a separate federation within India or a separate state outside India, based on the principle of self-determination. He also suggested that the provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir should form a single unit within this federation or state, as they had a common history, culture and language.
 
Iqbal's speech was widely applauded by the Muslim audience and received praise from many prominent leaders, such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later became the founder of Pakistan. Iqbal's speech also inspired many young Muslims to join the Pakistan movement and to strive for their political and cultural rights. Iqbal's speech is regarded as a milestone in the creation of Pakistan and a source of inspiration for the Pakistani nation.

- Islam is not only a religion but also a civilization and a culture that distinguishes the Muslims from other nations.
- The Muslims of India have a distinct identity and history that cannot be merged with the Hindu majority.
- The Muslims of India are a nation and deserve political representation and autonomy according to their population and interests.
- The best form of government for India is a federal system with maximum autonomy for the Muslim-majority provinces.

Iqbal's speech was based on his deep study of Islam, history, philosophy and politics. He drew inspiration from the Quran, the Sunnah, the Islamic mysticism, the Islamic philosophy, the Western philosophy and the modern political movements. He also referred to the examples of Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Egypt as Muslim countries that had achieved independence or reformed their political systems. He also acknowledged the role of Jinnah as the leader of the Muslims and urged him to guide them in their struggle for freedom. [^3^]
 
Iqbal's speech had a profound impact on the Muslim psyche and the Pakistan movement. It gave a new direction and vision to the Muslims who were disillusioned by the Congress and the British policies. It also challenged the Hindu and British claims that India was a single nation and that Muslims were a minority. It also provided a philosophical and ideological basis for the demand of Pakistan that was later articulated by Jinnah and the Muslim League. Iqbal's speech is regarded as one of the finest expressions of the Muslim aspirations and one of the classic documents of Pakistan's history.
